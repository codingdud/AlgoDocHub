# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At AlgoDocHub, we take security seriously and value the contributions of security researchers in responsibly disclosing potential vulnerabilities. If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, please report it to us immediately.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately Disclose the Issue:** Send an email to [security@algodochub.com](mailto:security@algodochub.com) detailing the vulnerability. Please include sufficient information for our team to reproduce and address the issue.

2. **Avoid Public Disclosure:** While we appreciate your efforts in identifying security concerns, we kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had an opportunity to review and address it.

3. **Provide Adequate Details:** In your report, include a clear description of the vulnerability, along with any steps or conditions necessary to reproduce it. Screenshots, videos, or proof-of-concept code can also be helpful in understanding the issue.

4. **Keep Communication Confidential:** We will handle your report with the utmost confidentiality. Our team will acknowledge receipt of your report and keep you informed of any progress or resolution.

5. **Responsible Disclosure:** We are committed to promptly addressing and resolving reported vulnerabilities. Once the issue has been verified and mitigated, we encourage responsible disclosure.

We appreciate your assistance in helping us maintain the security and integrity of AlgoDocHub. Thank you for your dedication to the safety of our users and contributors.

**Note:** This security policy applies to vulnerabilities within the AlgoDocHub project. For general inquiries or non-security-related matters, please refer to our [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) guide or contact us through appropriate channels.
